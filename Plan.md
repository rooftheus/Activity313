# Planning Document.

In this code, I will first instantiate a dictionary with all the different options/sizes of different menu items, and will make the values of these items the price. I will use a lot of if statements in order to figure out whether the user answered yes or no to a question, whether a user inputted a correct size and etc. Variables will have to include user inputs of whether they want a specific size of food and more. At the end, the prices will be added up according to the dictionary instantiated at the beginning.
