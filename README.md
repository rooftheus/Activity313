## ITERATION ONE
![Code of iteration one][iter one]
In this first iteration, the user can choose between chicken, beef, and tofu while being able to see the different prices for the sandwiches. The program then returns the user's sandwich choice as to not be at fault for a mistake in the order.

## ITERATION TWO 
**The code for this iteration can be found in iter_2.py on the rooftheus-iteration-2 branch. The code would not all fit in one screenshot**

In the second iteration, I first added a dictionary at the top of the code with all the menu items as well as the subsequent prices. This makes it a lot easier to add the prices later on. I then added a feature that asks the user whether they want a beverage, and asks them for the size they want(as well as the prices) if they respond with a yes. At the end, the program adds the total cost of the items so far.


* This program is meant to replicate the procedure in which anyone would **order food from a combo menu at a restaurant**. This product can be used by anyone who wants to eat at a restaurant and get a combo meal.

## ITERATION THREE
**The code for this iteration can be found in iter_3.py on the rooftheus-iter-3 branch. The code would not all fit in one screenshot**

The code for iteration three is relatively similar to the second iteration, with the added features having the same types of conditionals and variables as before. The program now asks the user whether they want fries or not, and goes through an assortment of conditionals to insure that the correct input is given. If the user inputs a wrong choice, large fries are automatically added to the order in its place (we are a money-hungry franchise). At the end, the program adds the cost of all the items that the user ordered.

## FINAL ITERATION
![Final Iteration Output][fin iter]
**The code can found in final-iteration.py on the main branch**

The code for final iteration is very close to the code of iteration three. The code first asks the user to input how many ketchup packets they want. Afterwards, the program wraps up the work done before by displaying the order and total cost, as well as adding other features such as subtracting a dollar from the cost if the user ordered a sandwich, drink, and fries. 

## FINAL INFO/THOUGHTS

During this project, I added a few extra features. This includes creating while loops in order to prevent the user from inputting an invalid input for the sandwich, beverage, and ketchup packets. For the fries, the program automatically adds large fries to the user's order if they do not respond with the right input (afterall, we were lenient the first and second time). I also used a dictionary and for loop in order to total the price of the order. Using a dictionary helped reduce the excessive amount of conditionals that the program already had, and led to more convenience in general, having to write less code. There were a few other minor tweaks, but they are not too significant. 

This project was a great experience for me. Even if I had previous experience with python, the assignment still felt unique, and gave me a sense of nostalgia (even if I am just a high schooler). I sort of jumped straight into intermediate projects when I started coding for myself (definitely not the best idea), so doing a more beginner project felt really nice. Overall, doing this project weirdly let me take my mind off any other stressors and made me feel calm. Thank you Mr. Baez.
