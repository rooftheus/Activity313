# Activity 313

## ITERATION ONE
![alt text][iter one]
In this first iteration, the user can choose between chicken, beef, and tofu while being able to see the different prices for the sandwiches. The program then returns the user's sandwich choice as to not be at fault for a mistake in the order.

## ITERATION TWO 
**The code for this iteration can be found in iter_2.py on the rooftheus-iteration-2 branch. The code would not all fit in one screenshot**

In the second iteration, I first added a dictionary at the top of the code with all the menu items as well as the subsequent prices. This makes it a lot easier to add the prices later on. I then added a feature that asks the user whether they want a beverage, and asks them for the size they want(as well as the prices) if they respond with a yes. At the end, the program adds the total cost of the items so far.


* This program is meant to replicate the procedure in which anyone would **order food from a combo menu at a restaurant**. This product can be used by anyone who wants to eat at a restaurant and get a combo meal.

## ITERATION THREE
**The code for this iteration can be found in iter_3.py on the rooftheus-iter-3 branch. The code would not all fit in one screenshot**

The code for iteration three is relatively similar to the second iteration, with the added features having the same types of conditionals and variables as before. The program now asks the user whether they want fries or not, and goes through an assortment of conditionals to insure that the correct input is given. If the user inputs a wrong choice, large fries are automatically added to the order in its place (we are a money-hungry franchise). At the end, the program adds the cost of all the items that the user ordered.
